# Description

One day I received a curious invitation from Google.

Upon learning more about the Foobar Challenge, I've decided to complete a few problems and this repository contains solutions.

Challenges are in the order of increasing complexity (1,2,3). 

All the solutions have been automatically verified by Google.

Please note that Python 2.7 is used
