# Description

Write a function solution(n) that takes the starting index n of concatenated string of all primes "2357111317192329..." and returns the next five digits in the string

Example: solution(3) = "71113"

Constraints: n is between 0 and 1000 inclusively

Solution: use "lazy" version of Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
