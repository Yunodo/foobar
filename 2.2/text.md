# Description and Solution

## Description

Write a function solution(xs) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers.

Example: xs = [2,-3,1,0,-5], then the maximum product is xs[0] * xs[1] * xs[4] = 2 * (-3) * (-5) = 30

Constraints: length of array is between 1 and 50 inclusively: no number in the array have absolute value greater than 1000

Solution(xs) should return a string representation of the number.

## Solution

Time Complexity: O(n)
